Grading
=======

Grades in this project will be based upon the writing and
project code/results that you produce. In the following I
detail each element.

Rubric for Writing
------------------

The proposal will be evaluated in the same way that each
research paper we read is. Key elements will include:

1. Does the proposal clearly articulate the problem and its
   importance, 
2. related work on the problem, 
3. a novel hypothesis (claim about the method/idea to solve), 
4. a method for demonstrating the hypothesis, 
5. a feasible and strong plan for evaluation, 
6. and a plan for carrying out the work.

The proposal will receive equal weighting for the above
elements. I will also grad with regard to clarity of
writing, but will place less emphasis here, however, note
that to clearly describe those points you must have clear
writing.

Grading for Code
----------------

TBD
