# Comp517 Project Proposal

Written proposal for the project that states the problem
you will address, the motivation for why this is an
interesting problem, the goal of your project, the
relationship between your project and other work, the plan
and methodology for your project, and the resources needed
to carry out your project. Include a set of incremental
milestones that you will achieve in carrying out the project
and a schedule for meeting these milestones.

## Assignment Requirements

TBD

## Grading Rubric

We will use the rubric as denoted in
[rubric.md](../rubric.md). 

## Notes on Proposal Writing

There are many ways to brainstorm for writing a proposal. I
have used all of these in my writings before. The above
requirements and rubric most closely follows the CARS method
while including a plan element. 

### Abstracts

Abstracts should be written for each project. These at a
later point can be programmatically parsed to generate
various views of projects: for example, graphing a set of
projects with there dependencies with mouse over pop ups for
abstracts.

### CARS

Projects may optionally include a CARS section. This section
lays out an argument for the work. It is typically a
precursor to a full paper, but is a mini-write up that
allows the argument to be played with at scale. 

It typically has a few parts:

1. Problem and relevancy; trend
2. Show the gap: existing work tries to do something but
   fails to adequately address some problem
3. Fill the gap: our work will resolve this problem by doing
   X

Please see links for further exploration of the CARS method.

### Sketch

Some projects may just be half baked and need to get a quick
statement on them to share the basics of the idea. This can
be done with a sketch. 

1. Problem?
2. Simple insight/hunch
3. Expected outcome

A sketch is similar to an abstract, and may be one. This
could also be described as answering Heilmeier's Catechism. 

### Heilmeier's Catechism

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives
  using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
  practice?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will
  be successful?
- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it
  make?
- What are the risks?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for
  success?  

### [Griswold How to Read](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html)

- Motivations: 1) People problem, 2) Technical Problem + why
  isn’t solved, 3) Research question
- What is the proposed solution: hypothesis
- How will you evaluate it?
